## About QuantGov

QuantGov is an effort to expand the frontiers of economic and legal research by providing an open-source framework to uncover the latent data in legal text. QuantGov grew out of the [RegData project](http://regdata.org/), which seeks to solve the longstanding problem of the quantification of federal regulation for use in economic analysis.

The progression from RegData to QuantGov reflects two realizations: first, that the kinds of tools used in RegData can be useful in other contexts, and second, that a clear framework could ease adoption of these methods and allow researchers to build off of one another's work without constant reinvention of the wheel.

This documentation describes the [QuantGov architecture](http://docs.quantgov.org/architecture), which consists of [corpora](http://docs.quantgov.org/corpus), [estimators](http://docs.quantgov.org/estimator), [projects](http://docs.quantgov.org/project), and [databanks](http://docs.quantgov.org/databank). The official QuantGov implementations of these pieces, including generic examples that can be customized for new tasks, can be found on the [QuantGov GitHub page](https://github.com/QuantGov).

## Get the Code

All code for official QuantGov projects is hosted on the [QuantGov GitHub page](https://github.com/QuantGov). QuantGov currently maintains four repositories:

-   [QuantGov/corpus](https://github.com/QuantGov/corpus), which holds official QuantGov corpora
-   [QuantGov/estimator](https://github.com/QuantGov/estimator), which holds official QuantGov estimators
-   [QuantGov/project](https://github.com/QuantGov/project), which holds official QuantGov projects
-   [QuantGov/documentation](https://github.com/QuantGov/documentation), which holds this documentation

## QuantGov Data

Published Datasets using the QuantGov framework include:

-   [RegData](http://regdata.org/data) : A dataset quantifying federal regulation in the United States from 1975-2014, and classifying regulations using the North American Industry Classification System

If you have a published dataset that uses QuantGov that you would like us to add to this list, please contact us [here](mailto:osherouse@mercatus.gmu.edu).
