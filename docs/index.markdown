# QuantGov

*A Framework for Uncovering the Latent Data in Legal Text*

## About QuantGov

QuantGov is an effort to expand the frontiers of economic and legal research by providing an open-source framework to uncover the latent data in legal text. QuantGov grew out of the [RegData project], which seeks to solve the longstanding problem of the quantification of federal regulation for use in economic analysis.

The progression from RegData to QuantGov reflects two realizations: first, that the kinds of tools used in RegData can be useful in other contexts, and second, that a clear framework could ease adoption of these methods and allow researchers to build off of one another's work without constant reinvention of the wheel.

This documentation describes the [QuantGov architecture], which consists of [corpora], [estimators], [projects], and [databanks]. The official QuantGov implementations of these pieces, including generic examples that can be customized for new tasks, can be found on the [QuantGov GitHub page].

## Get the Code

All code for official QuantGov projects is hosted on the [QuantGov GitHub page]. QuantGov currently maintains four repositories:

-   [QuantGov/corpus], which holds official QuantGov corpora
-   [QuantGov/estimator], which holds official QuantGov estimators
-   [QuantGov/project], which holds official QuantGov projects
-   [QuantGov/documentation], which holds this documentation

## QuantGov Data

Published Datasets using the QuantGov framework include:

-   [RegData] : A dataset quantifying federal regulation in the United States from 1975-2014, and classifying regulations using the North American Industry Classification System

If you have a published dataset that uses QuantGov that you would like us to add to this list, please contact us \[here\].
