# QuantGov

*A Policy Analytics Platform*

## About QuantGov

QuantGov is an effort to expand the frontiers of economic and legal research by
providing an open-source framework to uncover the latent data in legal text.
QuantGov grew out of the [RegData project](https://quantgov.org/regdata), which
seeks to solve the longstanding problem of the quantification of federal
regulation for use in economic analysis.

The progression from RegData to QuantGov reflects two realizations: first, that
the kinds of tools used in RegData can be useful in other contexts, and second,
that a clear framework could ease adoption of these methods and allow
researchers to build off of one another's work without constant reinvention of
the wheel.

This documentation describes the QuantGov framework, which consists of three
parts: - The [corpus](corpus.markdown), which defines a collection of
documents, - A set of [natural language](nlp.markdown) analysis functions that
can be applied to the documents in a corpus, and - A system for training,
packaging, and using [machine learning](ml.markdown) estimators to make
predictions about the documents in a corpus.

All code for official QuantGov projects is hosted on the [QuantGov GitHub
page](https://github.com/QuantGov). QuantGov currently maintains four
repositories:

-   [QuantGov/corpus](https://github.com/QuantGov/corpus), which holds official
    QuantGov corpora.
-   [QuantGov/estimator](https://github.com/QuantGov/estimator), which holds
    official QuantGov estimators.
-   [QuantGov/project](https://github.com/QuantGov/project), which holds
    official QuantGov projects.
-   [QuantGov/documentation](https://github.com/QuantGov/documentation), which
    holds this documentation.

## QuantGov Data

Published Datasets using the QuantGov framework include:

-   [RegData](http://regdata.org/data) : A dataset quantifying federal
    regulation in the United States from 1975-2014, and classifying regulations
    using the North American Industry Classification System.

If you have a published dataset that uses QuantGov that you would like us to
add to this list, please contact us [here](mailto:info@quantgov.org).
