# Introduction

This tutorial will take you through the steps to use QuantGov to analyze and categorize text documents. Specifically, you will:

-   Analyze documents published in the Federal Register in 2016 for word and restriction counts.
-   Use documents published in the Federal Register in 2015 to build an estimator to predict what section of the Register documents would be most likely to appear in.
-   Use the trained estimator to make predictions for the unlabeled 2016 Federal Register documents.
